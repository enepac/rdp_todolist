The Daily Planner is a Flutter-based application designed to manage daily tasks efficiently. It uses Firebase Firestore for data persistence and allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. The app supports editing, marking tasks as complete, and deleting tasks with a confirmation dialog.

### Key Features
1. **Task Creation**: Add new tasks with a name input limited to 32 characters.
2. **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted by tapping the status icon.
3. **Task Editing**: Modify the name of a task using a dialog box.
4. **Task Deletion**: Remove tasks with a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletion.
5. **Data Synchronization**: Synchronize task data in real-time with Firebase Firestore.
6. **Calendar Integration**: Display a monthly calendar for contextual reference.
7. **Responsive UI**: Ensures usability across varying device sizes.
